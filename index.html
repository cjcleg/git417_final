 		<h1>MAKING DECISIONS WITH JAVASCRIPT</h1>
 		<p>
 			When creating websites and other programs, it's often useful have code that performs different actions based on different conditions. For this exact purpose we have special types of statements called decision-making structures, or conditional statements. Conditional statements are present in many different coding languages but this tutorial will focus on the basics of using decision-making structures with Javascript. 
 		</p>
 		<p>
 			Decision-making structures in Javascript will come in handy when adding interactivity and intuition to your webpages. With Javascript you can gather information about your user, their browser, the time of day, and many other things and use that information to run different programs based on the different conditions that exist. Common examples of using these statements are running one set of code in the morning and another at night, a different set of code that coordinates to the day of the week, one set of code if a user has a larger screen, such as a desktop, and one set for if they have a smaller screen, such as a mobile phone, and to mitigate errors from browsers incompatibility. 
 		</p>
 		<p>
 			There are many different types of decision making structures, but in this guide we will explore only a few of the most common and useful types in the Javascript language: 
 		</p>
 			<ul>
 				<li>If Statements</li>
 				<li>If/Else Statements</li>
 				<li>Nested Conditional Statements</li>
 				<li>Else If Statements</li>
 				<li>Switch Statements</li>
 			</ul>
